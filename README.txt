CloudRF Batchjob

This Python script automates the generation of radio propagation calculations using the CloudRF API.
To use it you will need a CloudRF account (free!), Python, the Python 'requests' library and Google earth.

Concept:
The script reads in data from the CSV file, then performs a HTTP request to cloudrf.com for each row.
The result is a link to a KMZ file which the script downloads and launches in Google earth.
